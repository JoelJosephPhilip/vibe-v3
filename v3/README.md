# ViBe v3

Nx monorepo for the new ViBe frontend. It currently holds one app:

| Project | Path | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `student` | `apps/student` | Student-facing web app (Vite + React 19 + TypeScript) |
| `student-e2e` | `apps/student-e2e` | Playwright end-to-end tests for `student` |

## Stack

- **Build:** Vite, managed by Nx. Node 24 + pnpm.
- **UI:** shadcn (Base UI primitives) with the StyleUI **notio** theme, **sunny** colour scheme, Tailwind CSS v4.
- **Fonts:** Aleo for headings (self-hosted via `@fontsource-variable/aleo`); the system sans stack for body text.
- **Theme:** light by default, with a light/dark toggle (`next-themes`).
- **Tests:** Vitest + React Testing Library (unit/component); Playwright (e2e).

## Commands

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm nx dev student        # dev server on http://localhost:4300
pnpm nx test student       # Vitest
pnpm nx lint student
pnpm nx typecheck student
pnpm nx build student      # output: apps/student/dist
pnpm nx e2e student-e2e    # Playwright
```

Add shadcn components from `apps/student`, e.g. `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component>`.
